## Overview of Statistical Analysis:
      The purpose of the statistical analysis is to explore the temperature data in the months of 
      June and December in Oahu will sustain a year-round ice cream shop business.
      
## Results:
    The three key differences in weather between June and December are listed below:
      •	The total count between June and December are different.  December has 200 total count while June has 191 count.
      •	The temperature mean is higher in the month of June which is as expected as June is in the summer months. The December mean 
        temperature compared to June is lower by 6 degrees as it is the Winter season.
      •	Both June and December temperatures fluctuated.  The difference is that in June, the temperatures fluctuated from 71 to 
        80 degrees while in December, temperatures fluctuated from 60 to 78 degrees.

## Summery:
      Comparing the statistical summaries, the average temperature do not indicate the time when the temperatures were taken. 
      If the temperature was taken in the morning, it could change to up to 10 – 20 degrees in the afternoon.
      The lowest temperature recorded in December was 60 degrees, it might be cool for the local population but 
      for some tourists will find it perfect for vacation and even eating ice cream.  I would suggest running statistical 
      summaries for a few more months and if the data is available to correlate the temperature averages against the number of
      tourists visiting Oahu at that time.  It might help as well if the locals also partake in consuming ice cream at the same as the tourist.
