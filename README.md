## Summery:
      Comparing the statistical summaries, the average temperature do not indicate the time when the temperatures were taken. 
      If the temperature was taken in the morning, it could change to up to 10 â€“ 20 degrees in the afternoon.
      The lowest temperature recorded in December was 60 degrees, it might be cool for the local population but 
      for some tourists will find it perfect for vacation and even eating ice cream.  I would suggest running statistical 
      summaries for a few more months and if the data is available to correlate the temperature averages against the number of
      tourists visiting Oahu at that time.  It might help as well if the locals also partake in consuming ice cream at the same as the tourist.
