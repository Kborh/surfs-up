## Summary:
      comparing the statistical summaries, the average temperature do not indicate the time when the 
      temperature were taken. If the temperature was taken in the morning, it could change from 10 - 20 
      degrees in the afretnoon. The lowerest tmeperature recorded in December was 56 degrees, which might 
      have been cool for the local population, but some tourists will find it perfect for vactioning and 
      ice cream. I would recommand running statistical analysis for a few more months, and see if the outcome 
      correlate with the temperature averages against the number of tourists visiting Oahu at the time.
